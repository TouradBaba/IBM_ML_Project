# Project: Rain Prediction in Australia

## Overview

This project involves implementing and evaluating various classification algorithms using Python. The dataset used for this project is related to weather observations and includes features such as temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and more. The goal is to build and evaluate models for predicting whether it will rain tomorrow based on the given weather features.

## Project Steps

1. **Define a Function that Makes Graphs**
2. **Import and Explore the Dataset**
3. **Data Preprocessing**

4. **Linear Regression**
   - Train a Linear Regression model.
   - Evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R2-Score.
   - Display the results in a tabular format.

5. **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**
   - Train a KNN model.
   - Evaluate the model using Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, and F1-Score.

6. **Decision Tree**
   - Train a Decision Tree model.
   - Evaluate the model using Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, and F1-Score.

7. **Logistic Regression**
   - Train a Logistic Regression model.
   - Evaluate the model using Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and LogLoss.

8. **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
   - Train an SVM model.
   - Evaluate the model using Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, and F1-Score.

9. **Generate a Comprehensive Report**
   - Display the evaluation metrics for all the classification models in a final report.

## Installation Instructions

Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Use the following commands in your Python environment:

```bash
!pip install pandas
!pip install numpy
!pip install scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook.
3. Execute the code cells step by step to perform data preprocessing, train models, and evaluate them.
4. Review the final report to analyze the performance of each classification model.
